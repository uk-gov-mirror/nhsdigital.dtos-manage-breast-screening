# Manage breast screening

[![Main branch CI](https://github.com/nhsdigital/dtos-manage-breast-screening/actions/workflows/cicd-2-main-branch.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nhsdigital/dtos-manage-breast-screening/actions/workflows/cicd-2-main-branch.yaml)

The new service is a system for managing breast screening clinics, including:

- Viewing and managing daily clinic lists
- Tracking participants through their screening journey
- Managing participant information and status

## Running the app

## Setup

You will need to manually install a few prerequisites to bootstrap everything:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later
- [The suggested build environment for pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)

Then to install the rest of the toolchain, run:

```shell
make config
```

If you run into `command not found: pip` errors, make sure you have correctly configured your shell for asdf, i.e. updated the relevant dotfile, and reloaded it or opened a new shell.

## Running the app for the first time

```sh
make local
```

This will install dependencies, start the development instance of postgres (via docker), seed the database, and serve the app at http://localhost:8000

## Commands for local development

### Dev server

```
make run
```

This will run the dev server without reloading seed data. This is a shortcut for `poetry run ./manage.py server`.

### Tests

To run all the tests:

```sh
make test
```

Running `make config` beforehand will ensure you have necessary dependencies installed, including the browser needed by playwright for system tests.

For more details about writing tests see: [Testing approach](docs/testing-approach.md).

### Dependency management

Python dependencies are managed via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

- `uv sync` installs dependencies from the lockfile
- `uv add` and `uv remove` adds and removes dependencies
- `uv run [COMMAND]` runs a command in the context of the project's virtual environment

`npm` is used to manage javascript dependencies and frontend assets.

You can run `make dependencies` to install anything that's missing after pulling new changes from GitHub.

### Frontend assets

To compile assets, run `npm run compile`

To watch for changes, run `npm run watch`

This will compile scss files to css and bundle javascripts with [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/).

### Postgres database

The makefile spins up a postgres DB using docker/podman.

- `make db` starts it if not running
- `make rebuild-db` rebuilds it from scratch, including seed data

#### Migrations

Database migrations are handled by [Django's database migration functionality](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/migrations/)

- `uv run manage.py migrate` loads database migrations
- `uv run manage.py makemigrations` generates new database migrations

Note the database migration runs in the deployment pipeline _after_ the application deployment. The deployed code must be compatible with the schema before AND after the schema changes. This also removes potential errors when using a rolling app deployment as multiple app versions may access the database at the same time. To enforce it, make sure to always separate code changes and database migrations into different pull requests.

We are using [django-linear-migrations](https://adamj.eu/tech/2020/12/10/introducing-django-linear-migrations/) to manage conflicts in the migration history. If you get a conflict in `max_migrations.txt`, you will need to:

1. migrate back to the common anscestor migration, e.g. `uv run ./manage.py migrate mammograms 0030`.
2. rebase your git branch
3. resolve the migration conflict using `uv run ./manage.py rebase_migration`.

If you have multiple migrations on your branch, you will need to squash them together before running `rebase_migration`.

#### Demo data

There is a make task to seed a non-production instance of the service with example data

- `make seed-demo-data` or `make seed-demo-data ARGS=--noinput` to skip the confirmation

This command wipes the database entirely before populating it with fictitious data. The data is contained in yaml files in the [data directory](/data) and can be amended etc there as required.

### Django admin

Django admin is enabled at `http://localhost:8000/admin`

You must be logged in as a superuser to access it.

## Design

The service is deployed as a web application, backed by a postgres database with authentication provided by NHS CIS2. In addtion to these elements we will deploy a gateway application to each breast screening unit that uses the service that will be responsible for interop with local hospital systems. The gateway will be developed in a future phase of this project and is not currently under active development.

Display diagrams interactively:

- Run `make diagrams`
- Open `http://localhost:8080/` in a browser
- Select views from the sidebar or double click on diagram elements

Alternatively, [view all static diagrams](docs/diagrams/README.md).

### Structure

The `manage_breast_screening` directory contains all the Django project code.

`config` is a subpackage containing the configuration. The other subpackages - such as `clinics` - are [Django apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/applications/). These each represent a bounded context within our overall domain of screening events. Django apps can be built with customisability and extendability in mind, and published as python packages, but we aren't doing that yet.

To generate a new app, run:

```sh
uv run ./manage.py startapp <app_name> manage_breast_screening/`
```

## Deployment

See [Deployment](docs/infrastructure/deployment.md).

## Application secrets

The app requires secrets provided as environment variables. Terraform creates an Azure key vault and all its secrets are mapped directly to the app as environment variables. Devs can access the key vault to create and update the secrets manually.

Note [the process requires multiple steps](https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-devops-templates/tree/main/infrastructure/modules/container-app#key-vault-secrets) to set up an environment initially.

## Contributing

- Make sure you have `pre-commit` running so that pre-commit hooks run automatically when you commit - this should have been set up automatically when you ran `make config`.
- Consider switching on format-on-save in your editor (e.g. [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for python)
- (Internal contributions only) contact the `#screening-manage` team on slack with any questions

### Makefile and Scripts

`scripts/` contains various scripts that can be used in the CI/CD workflows.
